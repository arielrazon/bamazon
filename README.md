## what is Bamazon

Bamazon is a CLI-based purchasing app that integrates with MySQL, allowing customers to order products based on IDs

##usage

1. CLI will ask user for their **product ID** and **desired quantity**
2. Then CLI will show the user the **total price** of their decision
3. If the user wishes to proceed, the order will be placed, and the user will be brought back to the initial purchasing menu
4. If the user does not wish to proceed, they will be asked whether they wish to purchase other items. If not, the connection will close.
